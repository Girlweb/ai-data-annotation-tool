 AI Data Annotation & Quality Assessment Tool
A Python-based tool demonstrating professional data annotation, quality assessment, and evaluation capabilities for AI/ML projects.
   
Project Overview
This project showcases:
•	Image Classification & Annotation - Systematic categorization and labeling
•	Data Quality Assessment - Multi-criteria evaluation and scoring
•	Pairwise Comparison - Objective ranking and evaluation
•	Consistency Checking - Verification across datasets
•	Report Generation - Comprehensive documentation and export
 Features
1. Image Annotation
tool.annotate_image("IMG_001", "vehicle", confidence=5, notes="Clear image")
•	Categorize images with confidence levels
•	Add contextual notes for each annotation
•	Timestamp tracking for audit trails
2. Quality Assessment
tool.quality_check(data_entry, ['completeness', 'format', 'consistency'])
•	Multi-criteria evaluation
•	Automated scoring system
•	Detailed feedback generation
3. Pairwise Comparison
tool.pairwise_comparison(item_a, item_b, criterion="quality")
•	Side-by-side evaluation
•	Criterion-based ranking
•	Decision tracking and documentation
4. Report Generation
•	JSON format for detailed analysis
•	CSV export for spreadsheet compatibility
•	Summary statistics and metrics
Quick Start
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-data-annotation-tool.git
cd ai-data-annotation-tool
2.	Run the demo:
python data_annotation_tool.py
Requirements
•	Python 3.7 or higher
•	No external dependencies (uses only standard library)
Usage Examples
Basic Annotation Workflow
from data_annotation_tool import DataAnnotationTool

# Initialize the tool
tool = DataAnnotationTool()

# Annotate images
tool.annotate_image("IMG_001", "vehicle", 5)
tool.annotate_image("IMG_002", "person", 4)

# Perform quality checks
for annotation in tool.annotations:
    tool.quality_check(annotation, ['completeness', 'format', 'consistency'])

# Generate reports
tool.generate_report('my_report.json')
tool.export_to_csv('my_annotations.csv')
Custom Annotation Task
# Define your dataset
images = [
    {"id": "IMG_100", "category": "landscape", "confidence": 5},
    {"id": "IMG_101", "category": "portrait", "confidence": 4},
]

# Process annotations
for img in images:
    tool.annotate_image(img["id"], img["category"], img["confidence"])

# Check consistency
tool.consistency_check()
Sample Output
